        <p>Hey, I'm Tyler. Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet.</p>
        <p>My goal is to provide an afordable web development servise to as many people as possible. Sometimes 
            you need something more flexible and robust than what a Wordpress can give you. That is what I aim to deliver.
